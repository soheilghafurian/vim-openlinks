Wrtie a vim plugin that gives me an ex command. This ex command opens all the URL links in the given range. If no range given, it uses the current line as a range as is customary with ex commands.
It should definited take visual selection as range as well. It should support all range types that ex commands support.

If you there are stuff that I haven't specified, interview me about them.

For the name of the function and the name of the plugin, give me a few options and make me choose from among them.

First make a plan. And then do the implementation.

I want this plugin to be installable using vundle. 

I want you to write unit tests for this plugin as much as possible and run them and make sure they succeed.
